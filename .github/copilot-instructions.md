# Wordle React Application

This is a React application that implements a Wordle game. The development follows an iterative approach, with each stage building upon the previous one to introduce new React concepts and features.

## Project Structure
- `/src`: Contains all React source code
- `/public`: Static assets and HTML template

## Development Notes
- The project follows a step-by-step learning approach
- Each stage has specific learning goals for React concepts
- Testing is important for game logic validation
- Accessibility should be maintained throughout development
- Code organization should improve with each iteration

## Current Stage
The current implementation is Stage 3: Multiple guesses (limited to 6) with game over state and keyboard display, using a hardcoded target word "REACT".


## Prompts for Copilot to follow each time
understand explain the root cause of an error and propose possible solutions using dual coding: text and visually using mermaid diagrams. Prompt before modifing any code or executing any fix.

Always update the version number in `src/config/version.js` when making changes, and run the version update script to sync all files.

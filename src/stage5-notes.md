# Stage 5: Polish, Animations, and Accessibility

This final stage adds polish, animations, performance optimizations, and accessibility features to our Wordle clone.

## Key Features Implemented

### Animations
- **Tile Flipping**: When a guess is submitted, tiles flip to reveal their status with a staggered delay
- **Keyboard Press Effect**: Virtual keyboard keys animate when pressed
- **Modal Transitions**: Statistics modal has smooth fade and scale animations
- **Button Hover Effects**: All buttons have subtle hover and active state animations

### Keyboard Support
- **Full Keyboard Navigation**: Play the entire game using keyboard controls
- **Virtual Keyboard Integration**: Virtual keyboard is synchronized with physical keyboard input
- **Key Tracking**: Visual feedback shows currently pressed keys

### Accessibility Improvements
- **ARIA Attributes**: Proper labeling of game elements for screen readers
- **Focus Management**: Keyboard focus is handled appropriately
- **Status Announcements**: Game events announced for screen readers using aria-live regions
- **Skip Link**: Added a skip link for keyboard users to navigate directly to game controls
- **High Contrast Colors**: Maintained sufficient color contrast for visual accessibility
- **Keyboard Focus Indicators**: Clear visual indicators when elements are focused

### Performance Optimizations
- **React Hooks**: Using `useCallback` and `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Component Splitting**: Breaking down the app into smaller, reusable components
- **Optimized Rendering**: Only rendering components that need to change
- **Efficient Animation Handling**: Using CSS for animations rather than JavaScript where possible

### Responsive Design Improvements
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Layout adjusts for different screen sizes
- **Dynamic Sizing**: Game elements resize proportionally
- **Touch-Friendly Controls**: Larger touch targets for mobile users

## Technical Implementation Details

1. **Animation System**:
   - CSS keyframes define animations for flipping tiles and pressing keys
   - React state (`isRevealing`) controls when animations should trigger
   - Staggered animations using calculated delays

2. **Keyboard Integration**:
   - Window event listeners for keyboard inputs
   - State tracking for currently pressed keys
   - Virtual keyboard components with click and keyboard handling

3. **Accessibility Implementation**:
   - ARIA roles, labels, and live regions for screen reader support
   - Keyboard focus management for navigation
   - Hidden announcement elements for important game events

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Memoization of expensive functions and rendered elements
   - Component breakdown for better maintainability and performance
   - Refs for direct DOM access when needed

## Learning Outcomes
- Creating fluid, engaging animations in React applications
- Implementing proper keyboard navigation and accessibility features
- Optimizing React component performance
- Building responsive designs that work across devices
- Applying advanced React patterns like component composition

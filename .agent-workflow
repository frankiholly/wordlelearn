# AGENT WORKFLOW CHECKLIST
# Use this checklist EVERY TIME before running Node.js/npm commands

## PRE-FLIGHT CHECKS (MANDATORY)
1. ✓ Check Node.js compatibility: `./check-node.sh`
2. ✓ Use wrapper scripts for all Node.js operations:
   - `./run-with-nvm.sh npm start` (instead of `npm start`)
   - `./run-with-nvm.sh npm test` (instead of `npm test`)
   - `./run-with-nvm.sh npm install` (instead of `npm install`)
   - `./build-with-nvm.sh` (for building)
   - `./deploy-with-nvm.sh` (for deployment)

## AVAILABLE SCRIPTS
- `check-node.sh`: Check and setup Node.js environment
- `run-with-nvm.sh <command>`: Run any npm/node command with correct version
- `build-with-nvm.sh`: Build the project with correct Node version
- `deploy-with-nvm.sh`: Deploy to GitHub Pages with correct Node version

## CRITICAL RULES
- NEVER run `npm` commands directly
- ALWAYS use the wrapper scripts
- ALWAYS check Node.js compatibility first
- Project requires Node.js 22 LTS

## CURRENT PROJECT STATUS
- Project: Wordle Extreme (React-based Wordle clone)
- Node.js requirement: v22 LTS
- Main issue being worked on: Online dictionary validation
- Status: Testing and debugging online dictionary function

## DEBUGGING WORKFLOW
1. Run `./check-node.sh` first
2. Use `./run-with-nvm.sh npm start` to start dev server
3. Test online dictionary function in browser
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Make code changes as needed
6. Use `./run-with-nvm.sh npm test` for testing

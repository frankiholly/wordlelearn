# Floating Dictionary Error Dialog Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the user experience for dictionary validation errors by implementing a floating error dialog that appears directly above the current guess row when a word is not found in the dictionary.

## Problem Solved
**Previous Issue**: Dictionary error messages appeared in a fixed container below the game board, making them:
- Hard to see and easy to miss
- Far from the context (the word being typed)
- Poor user experience, especially on mobile devices

## Solution Implemented
**New Feature**: Floating error dialog that:
- Appears directly above the current guess row
- Shows contextual error messages right next to the problematic word
- Uses prominent styling with animations for better visibility
- Maintains responsive design for all device sizes

## Technical Implementation

### 1. New State Management
```javascript
// Floating error dialog state
const [floatingDictionaryError, setFloatingDictionaryError] = useState({
  show: false,
  message: '',
  word: ''
});
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
Updated all dictionary validation error scenarios:
- **Invalid word online**: Shows floating dialog above current guess
- **Dictionary check timeout**: Shows timeout message with floating dialog
- **Dictionary check error**: Shows error message with floating dialog

### 3. CSS Styling
- **Floating Dialog**: Modern gradient background with blur effects
- **Animations**: Smooth pulse animation on appearance
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Arrow pointer and proper z-index management

### 4. User Experience Flow
1. User types invalid word and presses Enter
2. Dictionary validation runs
3. If word is invalid:
   - Floating dialog appears above current guess row with animation
   - Traditional dictionary status container also shows the error
   - After animation completes, floating dialog auto-hides
   - Dictionary status remains longer for additional context

## Files Modified

### `/src/App.js`
- Added `floatingDictionaryError` state
- Enhanced error handling in `isValidWord` function
- Updated invalid word, timeout, and error scenarios
- Modified current guess row JSX to include floating dialog

### `/src/App.css` 
- Added `.floating-dictionary-error` styles
- Implemented `@keyframes floatingErrorPulse` animation
- Added responsive breakpoints for mobile devices
- Enhanced positioning relative to guess rows

### `/src/config/version.js`
- Updated version to `3.13.8`
- Updated build ID to `floating_dictionary_error_dialog`

## Benefits

### Improved Visibility
- Error messages appear exactly where user is looking
- Prominent styling ensures messages aren't missed
- Animation draws attention to the error

### Better Context
- Error appears next to the problematic word
- User doesn't need to look away from their input area
- Immediate feedback loop improves user understanding

### Enhanced Mobile Experience
- Responsive design adapts to smaller screens
- Floating position works well with virtual keyboards
- Improved touch interaction experience

### Maintained Functionality
- Original dictionary status container preserved
- All existing error types still supported
- Backward compatibility maintained

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Invalid Word Test**:
   - Type a non-dictionary word (e.g., "ZZZZZ")
   - Press Enter
   - Verify floating dialog appears above current guess
   - Verify message content is correct

2. **Timeout Test**:
   - Test with network issues or slow API responses
   - Verify timeout message appears in floating dialog
   - Verify proper cleanup after timeout

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**:
   - Test on various screen sizes
   - Verify floating dialog positioning
   - Confirm readability on small screens

4. **Animation Test**:
   - Verify smooth pulse animation on appearance
   - Confirm proper timing of show/hide sequence
   - Test animation performance across devices
